        <h3>Purpose, goals and audience</h3>
        <p>
            The purpose of "Rent a dog" is to give people who love dogs the opportunity to rent a dog for a certain period of time.
            The way we will do it is that the website must have an overview of the dogs that can be rented and a clear overview of which dogs are available or rented out.
            The overview should have lots of cute pictures and information about each individual dog to attract as many customers as possible.
            The aim of "Rent a dog" is to have a turnover of 1 banana in the first quarter of 2023, while at the same time aim to become the largest provider of rentable dogs in Norway.
            
            The audience of “rentadog” is everyone with a love for dogs. Does your kid want a dog? Rentadog is the perfect answer. Your kid will get the dog experience as many times as he likes, while you don’t have to care about the housing of the dog. 
            Are you in need of a date idea for a tinder match? With rentadog you can have a cute puppy at your disposal for a couple of hours. With a Labrador by your side, you will definitely get the girl of your dreams!
            The answer is that rentadog is for everyone. The perfect match for a dog shelter with loads of food and housing, and people who are looking for a dog, don’t have enough time for a dog or just like to go for walks and want to help others. The audience for rentadog is huge.

    <div>
        <h3>Content</h3>
            <p>There will be four separate pages as follow:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Homepage-homepage.html</li>
                        <p>The homepage will be the first page that will appear when users visit the website. 
                            The purpose of the homepage is to draw in the visitor of the website by incentivizing further use. 
                            The homepage will contain two sections. The first section will showcase the benefits using this specific website instead of the competitors. 
                            As agreed upon with the client, the three benefits will be as follow: 1) fair prices, 2) quality dogs, and 3) no fuzz. 
                            The second section will highlight three popular dogs. This will include a picture of the dog, its name and a characteristic. 
                            Beneath the dog highlight, there will be a video illustrating the joy of having a dog.

        <h3>Minimum Requirements</h3>
        <p> We plan to fulfil the minimum requirements of Javascript applications in this way:.

        </p>
        <p> Ove and Morten will be in charge of implementing:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>1.	In the order page you will be able to fill out an order for a dog.
                Each dog will have its own dog id, which you will have to use in the form. 
                You will also fill in your name, email, phone number, pick up time and return date.
                 The validation process will make sure your email contains a @, your phone number is numbers,
                your name is letters, and that the dates are valid dates. 
                This will be sent in and looked at by the workers. 
                You will get an email or text which will confirm or deny your order. 
                Obviously, you will not get an email or a text,
                 but you will receive a submitted message from the website. </li>
            
        </ol>
        <p>  Sondre will be in charge of implementing:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>2.	When you finish your order you will get a pop up on the screen which thanks you for your order. 
                This will be done in java and will be a reactive animation.</li>
            
        </ol>
        
        <p>Sander will be in charge of implementing:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                3.	When you click on a dog in the home page or our dogs the picture of the dog will grow. 
                By adding all pictures to a container or class and adding a command which makes them grow.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Marcus and Noah will be in charge of implementing:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                4.	On the website you can select filters for the dogs that you want. 
                If you want a boy or a girl, small or big, castrated or horny, and dates. 
                The only dogs who will show up are the dogs that fit the criteria. 
            </li>
        </ol>
