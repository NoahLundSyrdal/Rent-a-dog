    In our opinion they are in the main age group for our website. We also showed it to some our fellow studens.
    We did live testing with the students, as well as some of our product. We walked around A3 and found a lot of

    The live testing was probably the greated way to find ways to improve our website. When we sat behind the person

    The only constructive critisism we got came from the live testing.
