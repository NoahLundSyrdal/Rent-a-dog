    The questions we sent to the tester was most about custom critisism.
    We want to know how we can improve our website to make it easier to use for the consumer.
    Our main focus is making the ordering product as simple as it can be.

    We all shared the website to our parents, and some of us shared to our aunts and uncles as well.
    In our opinion they are in the main age group for our website. We also showed it to some our fellow studens.
    We did live testing with the students, as well as some of our product. We walked around A3 and found a lot of
    people we believed wanted to rent a dog. They count for 60% of the testing, and our familys count for around 40%.
    The live testing was probably the greated way to find ways to improve our website. When we sat behind the person
    ordering a dog, we could see how easy the website is to use. They could also tell us excactly what they were struggling with.
    The only constructive critisism we got came from the live testing.

    <p>Our testers used safari and google chrome, and it worked well on both the platforms.</p>

    Most of our testers were happy with the use of our website. They were really hapy about how they were able to sort the dogs, they liked
    the video, and wanted to order a dog after seeing the video. They even wanted to have an even bigger video. 
    They said the navbar was a great additition to navigate through the site.
    They enjoyed the name and the logo. 
    The order page is probably the page were we could improve, but it was still fine to order.
    One of our testers wanted to get directed to the order page with the dog id to the order page.

        The order page is where we see we could've done things differently.
