      <h3>Purpose, goals and audience</h3>
      <p>
          The purpose of "Rent a dog" is to give people who love dogs the opportunity to rent a dog for a certain period of time.
          The way we will do it is that the website must have an overview of the dogs that can be rented and a clear overview of which dogs are available or rented out.
          The overview should have lots of cute pictures and information about each individual dog to attract as many customers as possible.
          The aim of "Rent a dog" is to have a turnover of 1 banana in the first quarter of 2023, while at the same time aim to become the largest provider of rentable dogs in Norway.
          
          The audience of “rentadog” is everyone with a love for dogs. Does your kid want a dog? Rentadog is the perfect answer. Your kid will get the dog experience as many times as he likes, while you don’t have to care about the housing of the dog. 
          Are you in need of a date idea for a tinder match? With rentadog you can have a cute puppy at your disposal for a couple of hours. With a Labrador by your side, you will definitely get the girl of your dreams!
          The answer is that rentadog is for everyone. The perfect match for a dog shelter with loads of food and housing, and people who are looking for a dog, don’t have enough time for a dog or just like to go for walks and want to help others. The audience for rentadog is huge.
